Some notes about the technology stack:

Choosing to deliberately not use create-react-app, and instead to explicitly
add in the tools as we need them, so the stack is no more complex than exactly
what is needed, and it's controlled from top to bottom.

[Already brought in]
react/react-dom - obviously needed for UI

typescript - good choice for a more healthy codebase

webpack - bundles everything

ts-loader - loader for ts/tsx (consider awesome-typescript-loader?)

HtmlWebpackPlugin - used to dynamically inject the bundle name into the index

template found under public/, and dropped into the dist/ output directory.

webpack-dev-server - Development server configured to serve out of dist/ and
reload on changes

[Wishlist]
Some kind of source-map support, need to dig in here.

Hot module reload

scss
